  <p id="text">My Favorite Hobby is reading fiction books and my favorite author is Chris Colfer. I always try to read for atleast 30 minutes every night before going to sleep.  I am 12 years old and read in class 6th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
